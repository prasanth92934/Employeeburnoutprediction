# Employee Burnout Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee burnout using Linear Regression. Employee burnout is a serious concern that affects both individual well-being and organizational productivity. By leveraging historical data, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict burnout rates based on various features such as employee demographics, work conditions, and other relevant factors. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to help organizations implement preventative measures and improve employee satisfaction and retention.

## Who are the End Users of This Project?
The end users of this project are primarily HR professionals, managers, and organizational leaders who are responsible for employee well-being and productivity. Additionally, data analysts and researchers who focus on workplace health and productivity can utilize the model's insights. The predictions and insights provided by the model can help these users identify high-risk employees, implement targeted interventions, and develop policies to mitigate burnout and improve overall workplace satisfaction.

## My Solution and Its Value Proposition
The solution involves developing a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate employee burnout rates. By analyzing various factors such as employee demographics, job roles, work conditions, and other relevant data, the model can accurately predict which employees are at higher risk of burnout. The value proposition lies in providing organizations with actionable insights to proactively address employee burnout, thereby enhancing employee well-being, improving job satisfaction, and reducing turnover rates. This predictive capability enables organizations to implement timely interventions, optimize resource allocation, and foster a healthier work environment.

## Project Customization
To customize and personalize the project, several key steps were taken:

1. **Data Handling and Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns. This ensured that the data was accurate and suitable for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:** New features were created, such as calculating the number of days since the employee joined, to provide additional insights and improve model accuracy.

3. **Visualizations:** Custom visualizations were developed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the data and identify key patterns and trends.

4. **Model Selection and Tuning:** Linear Regression was selected for its simplicity and effectiveness in predicting continuous outcomes. The model parameters were fine-tuned to achieve the best performance.

5. **Interpretability:** Focus was placed on ensuring that the model's predictions were interpretable and actionable, providing clear insights into the factors contributing to employee burnout.

## Modelling
The modelling phase involved several critical steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The data was cleaned by removing missing values and irrelevant columns. Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to make them suitable for the model.

2. **Feature Selection:** Important features were selected based on their correlation with the target variable, 'Burn Rate'. This helped in reducing dimensionality and improving model performance.

3. **Train-Test Split:** The dataset was split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split. This ensured that the model could be evaluated on unseen data.

4. **Scaling:** The features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model performance.

5. **Model Training:** A Linear Regression model was trained on the training data. This algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and ability to provide interpretable results.

6. **Model Evaluation:** The model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared score. These metrics provided a comprehensive view of the model's accuracy and performance.

7. **Visualization:** The predicted values were visualized against the true values to assess the model's fit. Additionally, a regression line was plotted to show the relationship between the predicted values and the indices.

## Results
The Linear Regression model's performance was evaluated using various metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Provides the square root of the MSE, giving an idea of the average error magnitude.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Indicates the average absolute error between actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared Score:** Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.

Visualizations of predicted values against actual values, including a regression line, demonstrated the model's performance.
